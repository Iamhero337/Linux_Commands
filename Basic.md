Lets, start with the most basic ones.

In terminal:

cd : change directory.

example:
 You are in home directory and you want to go to download from here
 (The folder you want to go to must be in your sub directory)

 $ cd Downloads

 (voila you have changed your directory.)

 ls:list every kind of file in current directory

 example:
    You are in downloads section and you have 3 files {1.txt,wh.apk,wallpaper.jpg}

 $ls

 1.txt
 wh.apk
 wallpaper.jpg
